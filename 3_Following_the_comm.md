3.      Following the comment above, when ML was used for categorical
data with extreme nonnormality, it was not surprised that the ML
chi-square as well as fit indices calculated based on the chi-square
statistic indicated poor model fit. However, it does not necessarily
indicate that the two-factor model did not fit the data. If a proper
estimation method was used, the model fit may improve.
