5.      The EFA analyses indicated two- and three-factor solutions, but
a theory-driven four-factor model came up to be the best-fitting model.
Statistically, it is expected that with more parameters freely
estimated, the model would fit better. This makes me wonder whether the
EFA analyses were necessary and worth to be reported, since the final
model did not take the EFA suggestions.
