6.      The authors do not indicate in sufficient detail how the sample
was identified and selected.  How many schools were approached to
participate in the study and how many chose not to participate? How many
students were approached to participate in the study and how many chose
not to participate? Are there specific exclusionary or inclusionary
variables other than grade level? What is the response rate? This
information is readily available. Although they may not need to be
repeated at length in this manuscript, the authors should at least
indicate where the comprehensive information can be obtained.
