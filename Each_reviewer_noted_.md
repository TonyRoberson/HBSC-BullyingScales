Each reviewer noted positive aspects of your research and the associated
manuscript. However, numerous concerns were also noted. I invite you to
respond to these concerns and revise your manuscript. While I will not
restate all of the concerns raised by reviewers I would like to
highlight Reviewer 1’s concern regarding the apparent disconnect between
the EFA results presented and the use of CFA. The correlation of .87
between perpetration and cyber-perpetration, and to a lesser extent the
correlation of .7 between victimization and perpetration, indicate
common variance and seem to support the two-factor model. A stronger
argument is needed to support the four factor model, especially given
that the fit criteria used in for CFA are very liberal. Please provide
additional rationales and citations to support your use of fit criteria.
For example, there are published simulation studies that can be used to
support the use of fit criteria. Additionally, please address Reviewer
1’s concern regarding the use of ML rather than an estimator such as
WLSMV that seems to be more appropriate given items with non-normal
distributions. In relation to this concern, consider presenting means,
standard deviations, and estimates of skew and kurtosis for the observed
variables in this study.
