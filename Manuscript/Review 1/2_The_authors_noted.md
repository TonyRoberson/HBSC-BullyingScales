2.      The authors noted that items have extremely nonnormal
distributions and used a maximum likelihood (ML) estimation. However, ML
requires data to be multivariate normally distributed. With nonnormally
distributed data in this study, ML is likely to provide an inflated
chi-square statistic and biased parameter estimates. Moreover, it had
not been specified whether responses on the five-point Likert scale were
analyzed as continuous or categorical data. Given the categorical nature
of data, a more appropriate estimation method is robust weighted least
square estimation (e.g., WLSMV).
