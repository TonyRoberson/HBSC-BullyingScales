6.      The authors used CFI &gt; .85 to indicate adequate mode fit,
which for me is a little questionable based on the conversion of CFI
&gt; .90 or .95. When the configural models had relatively low CFIs at
.86-.87, it may not be needed to conduct subsequent measurement
invariance analyses since the configural model did not fit very well. In
addition, it would be helpful to conduct the chi-square difference tests
for model comparisons.
