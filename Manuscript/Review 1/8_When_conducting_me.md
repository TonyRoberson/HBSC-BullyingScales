8.      When conducting measurement invariance analyses, the model fit
for each individual group should be tested and reported before making
any parameter constraints. Also, the parameters on which constraints
were made for each model should be clarified. In addition, the estimated
standardized mean differences used for evaluating the factor means were
not clearly defined or referred. It is thus difficult to evaluate the
appropriateness of the procedure. Moreover, the significance of latent
means would need further interpretations.
