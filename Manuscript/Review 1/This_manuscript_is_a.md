This manuscript is a relatively brief research report of “. . . the
latent factor structure of the 22 victimization and perpetration items
within the 2009–2010 Health Behavior in School-aged Children (HBSC)
self-report survey.” The author(s) are commended for their efforts to
add to the literature regarding bullying and the measurement of
bullying. The study’s findings are significant and appear meaningful. In
addition, the statistical analyses appear solid.  However, there are
several concerns that need to be addressed to improve this manuscript.
